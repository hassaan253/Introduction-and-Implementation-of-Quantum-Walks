## Project Description
We will use "Quantum random walks - an introductory overview" by J. Kempe as our source guide. It contains a purely theoretical overview of classical random walks. and their quantum analogues which are called Quantum Walks. We will code the given algorithms and create Jupyter notebooks that will run both classical random walks, discrete Quantum Random Walks(DQRW) and Continuous time quantum random walks(CTQRW). We will also aim to create simple animations depicting the Quantum Walks to give a better intuition and serve as a teaching tool.
